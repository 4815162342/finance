# Privacy-Centric Finance Manager
This open-source app makes it really easy to manage all your financial transactions without having to trust a third party. It's currently really hard to keep track of your money as it travels through all your services - banks, credit & debit cards, Venmo, brokerage accounts, etc. Great solutions exist like Quicken and Mint, but they all come with some drawback. For a few, it's being locked into an annual subscription. For others, it's handing over your financial data to an untrusted third party who could comprise or sell your data. This web app aims to fix both those problems. 

I built this tool to solve a problem I had. I hope it helps you too.

## Getting started
Running the app couldn't be easier:
```
git clone https://github.com/4815162342/finance
cd finance
npm start
```
